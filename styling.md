### Style Guide

# Components
- All component declarations must be functions, not lambda variables

# Imports/Exports
- All exports must be default
  - Each default export will be written at the bottom of the file
- All local imports must use absolute path (with aliases where applicable) unless a file is in the same or a child directory.
- Imports will be in alphabetical order
